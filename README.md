An exploration and generation of a website on being transgender

A place where people who are possibily questioning whether they themselve are transgender, or if they have a friend or family member who is transgender, and wish to learn more about the topic in order to be a better ally to those in the trans community.

The website covers topics such as; What the word 'Transgender' means, a way to help people decide if what they are feeling is gender identity related or otherwise, names and pronouns, what treatments are available to them, and how to pass as their preferred gender.
