                    <p>Trans people may want to use hormones to develop secondary sex characteristics. This is known as Hormone Replacement Therapy. Hormones can be prescribed by a GIC or they can be purchased privately. The hormones can be self-administered or administered by medical professionals depending on the type of hormones used.</p>

                    <p>For trans women, the types of hormones prescribed are estrogens, antiandrogens, and progestogens. Estrogen comes in the forms of pills, skin patches and injections. Antiandrogens and progestogens come in the forms of pills. The dosage of these hormones varies from person to person and will be discussed with your GP and GIC. You will be monitored for the first few years of your transition and these dosages may be altered for best results and suited to your individual needs. </p>

                    <p>The timeframe of changes varies from person to person. While it is easy to compare your transition to others, please understand that every one is different. Some of these changes will be permanant, and some will be reversed if HRT is stopped. While some or most of these changes will be desired by trans women, not all of them are pleasant or wanted changes, but it is not possible to pick and choose which changes will happen. There are also risks to be considered when starting HRT, such as long-term liver damange, increased risks of blood clots, diabetes and heart disease and headaches or migranies. These risks will be discussed at the time of prescription and will be monitored throughout your transition.

                    <p>For trans men, the main type of hormone prescribed is testosterone. It can come in the form of a gel or an injection. There are two types of injection; self administered into the thigh, or administered via a healthcare professional in the muscle of the butt. The time frame between each shot varies depending on the person and the type of injection chosen but these shots will have to be administered for the rest of your life. As with trans women, you will be monitored for the first few years of your transition to ensure your transition is progressing well.</p>

                    <h4 class="light-blue-text text-lighten-2">Mental Health</h4>
                    <p>For both trans men and women, HRT can affect their mental health in both positive and negative ways. For most, the positive mental health boost comes from seeing changes to their bodies after starting HRT and feeling like they are finally becoming who they're meant to be. For some however, HRT can destabiliase their moods and cause mood swings and depression. This will also be monitored throughout your transition.</p>
