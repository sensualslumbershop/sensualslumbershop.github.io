                    <p>Finding a Gender Identity clinic or GIC isn't as difficult as it once was. The internet can help you find a GIC nearest to you, however most GICs won't accept self-referral patients, meaning you will have to go through your GP. Your GP will refer you to your nearest GIC and then they will get back to you with an appointment. Waiting times for that first appointment can be long, GICs are few and far between and need to see people from a wide area. Also due to lack of research and funding into gender healthcare they can be short staffed.</p>

                    <h4 class="light-blue-text text-lighten-2">First appointment</h4>
                    <p>The first appointment can be daunting, especially if you have waited a long time, but there is nothing to worry about. The first appointment is all about assessing why you have been referred and how they can help you. There will be a lot of questions about your background, current circumstances and what you would like your future to be like. It can be helpful to write a list of questions you want to ask to make sure you leave knowing what you wanted to know, and it helps to write things down while you're there to help you remember or come back to things at a later date. Make sure you know what should happen next after that first appointment and that you know who to contact should you need and help or advice. Hormones will not be given at first appointments.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="light-blue-text text-lighten-2">Second appointment</h4>
                    <p>The second appointment is usually with someone else either alongside the first clinician you saw or alone. They will review the things you talked about with the first clinician and ask for any updates or changes in the way you feel since your first appointment. They may repeat questions from the first appointment or go into more depth with specifics discussed prior, but its not a test or anything to worry about, they just want to make sure they understand your needs. Sometimes, your clinicians may have decided that you are ready to go on hormones by this appointment if thats what you want. Sometimes it may take a few more sessions with them before they make a decision. Don't be afraid to ask. They will take you through any risks involved with HRT and the changes you can expect in a rough time frame. Learn more about HRT <a href="hrt.html">here.</a></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Once you have begun whatever treatment it is you need, you will have follow up appointments. If you have begun HRT then you will have follow up appointments to check the progress of your treamtment and provide you with any help you may need during your transition. This can be anything from referring you to other services, prescribing secondary treatments for potential side effects, and surgical referrals, amongst other things.</p>
